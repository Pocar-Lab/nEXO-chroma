    Makes an HDF5 file with the desired header information

    You can pass anything under 64kb into attributes and it will be saved along with the file. 
    This includes things such as a notes section
    To read attributes, use

    f.attrs.get[<attribute_name>].

    It also creates two datasets, one called tallies and one called tracks

    Note, specifying dataset shape will ensure that file creation goes smoothly.
    The tracks dataset has the shape (<number of steps> + 1, <number of tracks to be saved>, 3)
    You should also specify the total number of rows (photons) in the tallies arrays
