### PHOTON GENERATION SUB-FUNCTIONS

# Here are a family of sub-functions that are used by the photon generator object
# Source functions should take number of particles, a source location, and a kwargs statement
# Direction functions should take a number of particles and a kwargs statment
# Source kwargs:
#     - source_r: Radius of the source
#     - rng: numpy random number generator object
#     - rot_matrix: a 3x3 np array to rotate the resulting vectors into the desired orientation using matrix multiplication

# Direction kwargs:
#     - beam_declination: The angle between source_axis and the beam (in radians)
#     - beam_azimuth: The angle of the beam about source_axis (in radians)
#     - cone_angle: the angle of the cone (in radians)
#     - rng
#     - rot_matrix

# These functions aren't neccesarily intended to be called by external programs, but they can if you want them to
